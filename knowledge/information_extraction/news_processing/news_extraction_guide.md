# News Information Extraction and Processing Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the specific **News Information Extraction** system implemented in the InstructLab taxonomy. The system teaches language models to extract structured JSON data from news articles and snippets, designed for automated analysis and agentic workflows. The implementation utilises a **two-agent architecture** with standardised JSON output formats.

**Input Format**: All news articles are prefixed with "ARTICLE: " to ensure consistent preprocessing and model recognition of news content.

## Specific Extraction Components

### 1. Entity Recognition Examples
Our system extracts these particular entity types:

**People Examples**:
- "Jerome Powell" (Fed Chair)
- "Andriy Kovalenko" (Military spokesman)  
- "Emmanuel Macron" (French President)

**Organisations Examples**:
- "Federal Reserve", "Ukrainian forces", "European Union"
- "Major oil companies", "Tech giant", "27 member states"

**Locations Examples**:
- "Washington", "Kyiv, Ukraine", "Donetsk region"
- "London", "Middle East", "San Francisco", "Brussels"

### 2. Topic Classification Implementation
Our system assigns these particular main_topics:

**Economic Topics**: `["monetary_policy", "interest_rates", "economic_policy"]`
**Military Topics**: `["military_conflict", "territorial_defense", "international_monitoring"]`
**Energy Topics**: `["energy_markets", "oil_prices", "geopolitical_tensions", "supply_disruption"]`
**Technology Topics**: `["quantum_computing", "technology_breakthrough", "stock_market", "cryptography"]`
**Political Topics**: `["international_sanctions", "energy_policy", "diplomatic_relations", "eu_politics"]`

### 3. Key Facts Extraction
Our system identifies particular, actionable facts:

**Economic Example**: 
- "Interest rate cut of 0.25%"
- "Decision was unanimous among board members"
- "Cut takes effect immediately"

**Military Example**:
- "Major offensive repelled in Donetsk region"
- "Three enemy positions neutralized"
- "Attack lasted approximately 6 hours"

### 4. Implications Analysis
Our system generates forward-looking implications:

**Economic**: "Potential increase in consumer spending"
**Military**: "Continued military activity in eastern Ukraine"
**Energy**: "Market volatility expected to continue"
